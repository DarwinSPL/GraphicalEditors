# GraphicalEditors

The project provides the functionality for a graphical editor for the definition of Cross-Tree Constraints for the tool suite DarwinSPL.

Therefore, it is necessary to install DarwinSPL beforehand. (https://github.com/DarwinSPL/DarwinSPL/)

Installation:

1. Install DarwinSPL and all prerequisites.

2. Set up an Eclipse IDE as described by GEF (https://github.com/eclipse/gef)
   -> The second point can be ignored, since the '[Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers (Neon)](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages)'     should already have been downloaded during the installation of DarwinSPL.
   
3. Install GEF into your Eclipse installation.
   Via "Help -> Install New Software...", point to the newest 'Release update-site' (
   [GEF update-sites](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.gef/downloads)).
